       I would recommend to install quickFilters instead.
       
  4.17.1 QuickFolders Pro - 06/11/2019
	  ## Tb68 regression: when the shortcuts combinations SHIFT+S, SHIFT+M, SHIFT+J are used in 
       the quick filter search field, they are accidentally executed. This is because some 
       input types have changed in Thunderbird 68 following deprecation of XUL elements.
	  ## [Issue 11] - in 4.17, Thunderbird 60.* the quickMove / quickJump function did not
       bring  up any search results. Caused by swapping out the type="search" attribute
       for is="search-textbox" (usage with the newer search-textbox control)

    ## Added Alt + Up as navigation shortcut to go to parent folder.

    ## improved dropmarker behavior when dragging tabs over multiple rows 
    ## in the dialog "change order of tabs" the up and down labels on the buttons are not rendered for some reason
       this is now worked around by removing the button styling from these elements
