- label make closing tabs and replace values

30/11/2021
Completed conversion for remaining parts of options.html -
 buttons and checkbox labels, i18n, de-chrome (most) icon paths
 
 Pattern:
 <checkbox /> <label value="__myText__"/>
 =>
 <label> <input type="checkbox" >__myText__</label>
 
Next Steps: reference conversion, replace native icons. 
- Can icons from Thunderbird still be accessed by a html page? or do we need to supply copied versions...


roll out all data-pref- changes to all elements.

support or convert <radiogroup> !!!

Radiogroups wired up!


<fieldset orient="horizontal">  - changed to class=hbox.

<separator> to <span class="separator">

Support for collapsed attribute:
*[collapsed=true] {
  display: none !important;
}




Added a class for buttons with icons and tabs in order to add icons (behave like list icons):
button[isTab], button.iconButton {
  display: list-item;
  list-style-position: inside;
}

Added test config option to suppress xul options dialog (general debug mode must also be enabled):
extensions.quickfolders.debug.suppressXULoptions

support for sliding alert (accessibility for blind people)

TO DO:

- wiring up events:
#  Version number - open version history

#  Bling / Layout
   initBling( ) function.
   - Themes dropdown
   - all number inputs
   - color pickers
   
   
   
#  Quick Help - open homepage   
#  Support tab:
   - YouTube channel
   - bug report
   - 
#  License tab: 
   - Save Configuration / Load Configuration
   - Advanced Seach settings (opens new window)

- reuse existing options window, is this possible?

- wire up color pickers: at the moment there are no bound prefs - use a background notification for this?

- convert palette dropdowns to <option> elements  

- white fill color for selected tab.

-moz-image-region = seems to be without alternative. (see paste button for license)

remove "sizetopopup" for menus
removed 


Questions for Monday:
  how to use folder.createFolder to 
  
  
========    
 14/02/2022
  
  #  Bling / Layout
 rewrote  initBling( ) function.
 fixed Themes dropdowns
 fixed color pickers
 
 Combined 2 listeners for notifyTools (from legacy code) and windows message listener (from html windows / API code)
 into a single handler 
 
 
========    
 15/02/2022
 
 to do - event handlers for  all number inputs
 
 - create alternative color popups for selecting color choices in HTML
 note that these can be cut off by the dialog's viewport, hence it should
 be strictly flexible layout and needs to be placed centrally (near the dropdown select
 element but centrally on viewport)
 As there are 20 values, best would be 4 columns with 5 entries each.
 
 - use the management library to reopen existing settings window instead of a new one
 
  removed extensions.quickfolders.debug.suppressXULoptions and added a "classic options" menu item for now.
  
  added command handlers for checkboxes, most dropdowns and buttons (WIP)
  added right-click handlers for hidden settings (about:config)
  Added theme support through
  <meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">
  
  using a global listener in quickfolders-tablistener for "unique" commands that 
  should only be executed once (by one of the main windows)
   
========
