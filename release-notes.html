<b>5.9.1 Maintenance Improvments</b>
<li> Simplified recent folders menu behavior for keyboard navigation.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/254">[issue 254]</a> The new "=" key of quickMove/quickJump shows an arrow to visit child folders which means that the folder itself cannot be opened with keyboard only (by pressing the enter key), which forced the  user to use the mouse, impeding the workflow.

I have decided to instead not show subfolders for these recent folders as it doesn't add much value for what essentially should be a repeat operation. I have also extended this to the other recent folders menus (e.g. on the recent folders tab). 

The old behavior (of showing subfolders) can still be restores by setting the config setting <tt>extensions.quickfolders.recentfolders.subfolders = true</tt>
</li>
<li> 
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/252">[issue 252]</a> Fixed: Tabs with invalid folder address can break search results. This can happen if you exclude accounts from the search after recreating a profile with different spelling.
</li>
<li> 
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/255">[issue 255]</a> Fixed: CTRL Right-clicking on the active folder can create multiple instances of the folder commands submenu.
</li>
        

<b>Improvements - 5.9</b>
<ul>
<li>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/241">[issue 241]</a> using quickJump / quickMove via shortcut - hitting Enter will now always select the last successful location (even when the name is ambiguous) and not the top item of the menu. To use the first item of the menu using Enter the menu hast to be visible - either by starting to type or pressing arrow-down. 
</li>
<li>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/242">[issue 242]</a> Use '=' key for folders from recent quickMove / quickJump operations

When using the quickMove or quickJump search box you can now access folders of its previous jump / move operations by typing "=" as the first character.
</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/236">[issue 236]</a> Convert options dialog to pure HTML. Amon other things, this fixes the color pickers that have stopped working on Mac. Long term, all Dialogs and User Interfaces need to be converted to HTML
to become future proof and pure API based. There are still things that cannot be done with HTML right now (such as folder dropdowns that aren't cut off at the toolbar borders), so this is an ongoing effort for the predictable future.
</li>
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes - 5.9</b>
<ul><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/232">[issue 232]</a> Fixed: When Adding a category to a tab, another category may be replaced </li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/235">[issue 235]</a> Fixed: quickJump may fail if "Compact mode" in folder tree is enabled.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/220">[issue 220]</a> Fixed an issue with license validation (alias identity support). </li>
<li> Fixed "change order" dialog. </li>
</ul>
