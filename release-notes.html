<b>Maintenance Version 5.10.1 - 05/07/2022</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/281">[issue 281]</a> 5.10.1 - this maintenance fix stores the account id for every tab. 

When upgrading to Thunderbird 102, this can potentially rename the servers due to  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573690">bug  1573690</a> - then the account can be used for reconstruction of invalid folders. I am currently working on code that can help in fixing this problem automatically.</li>
<li> Fixed icon spacings in folder popup menus in Tb102. </li>
</ul>

<b>Thunderbird 102 Specific changes</b>
<ul>
<b>Known Issue:</h4>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/281">[issue 281]</a> Updating to Thunderbird 102 can generate invalid tabs - make sure to backup prefs.js before updating in order to correct this problem more easily. Some accounts in your profile may be affected, so it is a good idea to mitigate this problem.</li>



<li>Increasing maximum TB version for next ESR - Thunderbird 102.* is planned to be supported from now on. Also increased minimum version to 91.0 - because of new APIs 78 will not be supported with new features / bugfixes.</li>      
<li>Fixed repair folder code.</li>
<li>Fixed support site links in Options Dialog.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/272">[issue 272]</a>Implemented new folder listener interface. The new version of Thunderbird implements a different folder listener interface. This meant a lot of functions (such as updating URLs when renaming folders and updating their connected tabs or updating unread counts on the tabs) were broken.</li>
</ul>
